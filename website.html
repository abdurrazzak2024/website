                An ATM (Automated Teller Machine) system is a crucial part of modern banking infrastructure, providing
                customers with
                24/7 access to their bank accounts for various transactions such as withdrawing cash, checking account
                balances,
                transferring money, and more.

                Here’s a basic breakdown of how an ATM system works and what components are involved:

                Key Components of an ATM System:
                ATM Machine: The physical hardware where users interact with the system. This includes:

                Card Reader: Reads the debit/credit card inserted by the user.
                PIN Pad: A keypad for entering the PIN (Personal Identification Number).
                Display Screen: To display the ATM interface and instructions.
                Cash Dispenser: A mechanism to dispense cash when the transaction is approved.
                Receipt Printer: Prints transaction receipts for users.
                Network Connection: Connects the ATM to the bank's central system to communicate for transactions.
                Bank Server: The bank’s backend system where all transactions are processed. It verifies the user’s
                credentials, checks
                the account balance, and authorizes the transaction.

                ATM Software: The program running on the ATM that facilitates user interaction, executes transactions,
                and communicates
                with the bank’s server. It typically has a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use.

                Basic Flow of an ATM System:
                User Authentication:

                The customer inserts their ATM card into the card reader.
                The ATM reads the card information (like the account number).
                The user is prompted to enter their PIN on the PIN pad.
                The ATM system sends the card details and PIN to the bank server for validation.
